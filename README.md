# Packages

## Microsoft Teams & Zoom

Necessary in order to follow online lessons

## WPS Office

WPS Office is an office suite for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android, and HarmonyOS developed by Zhuhai-based Chinese software developer Kingsoft. It also comes pre-installed on Fire tablets. WPS Office is made up of three primary components: WPS Writer, WPS Presentation, and WPS Spreadsheet.

**Why WPS Office over Libreoffice?**

WPS Office has better compatibility with Microsoft Office files, which is better for students whose teachers use the Microsoft Office Suite.

## Visual Studio Code

[Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/)  is an integrated development environment made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git.

## Kate

VS Code is too heavy and bloated for your taste? Try [Kate](https://kate-editor.org/), the open source code editor developed by the KDE free software community.

### Konsole

Option dependency for Kate: it allows kate to have a built-in terminal.

## Joplin

Joplin is an open source note-taking app. You can take **notes**, make to-do list and sync your **notes** across devices by linking it with cloud services. The synchronization is protected with end to end encryption.

## Xournal ++

is an application for notetaking, sketching, keeping a journal using a stylus. It is free software (GNU GPL) and runs on Linux (recent distributions) and other GTK+/Gnome platforms. It is similar to Microsoft Windows Journal or to other alternatives such as Jarnal , Gournal, and NoteLab.

## MarkText

MarkText is a simple and elegant open-source markdown editor that focused on speed and usability.

## Calibre

Calibre is a cross-platform open-source suite of e-book software. Calibre supports organizing existing e-books into virtual libraries, displaying, editing, creating and converting e-books, as well as syncing e-books with a variety of e-readers. Editing books is supported for [EPUB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB "EPUB") and [AZW3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kindle_File_Format "Kindle File Format") formats. Books in other formats like MOBI must first be converted to those formats, if they are to be edited.

## Evince

Evince is a document viewer for multiple document formats. The goal of evince is to replace the multiple document viewers that exist on the GNOME Desktop with a single simple application.

Evince is specifically designed to support the file following formats: PDF, Postscript, djvu, tiff, dvi, XPS, SyncTex support with gedit, comics books (cbr,cbz,cb7 and cbt).
